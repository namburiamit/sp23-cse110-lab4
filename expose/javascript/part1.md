# Part 1

1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. ERROR
   * The variable defined _result_ was defined by the keyword **let** which just has block scope (if block in this case). Accessing it outside the if-block will return an error in line 13. 

5. ERROR
   * The **constant** keyword was used to define _result_ to be 0. The use of **constant** keyword makes _result_ = 0 always and can not be altered later. In line 7 _result_ = num1 + num2 which is not the correct use of the constant. Hence, there is an error in line 9.

6. ERROR
   * The **constant** keyword was used to define _result_ to be 0. The use of **constant** keyword makes _result_ = 0 always and can not be altered later. In line 7 _result_ = num1 + num2 which is not the correct use of the constant. 
   * Because of this there is already an error with _result_ and can't print it out in line 13.
